Application development support
================================

This package provides reusable support for implementing networked service
publishing and discovery applications.

The higher-level application development support is found in their own `discovery` and
`publishing` modules. The threaded networking implementation is split into its own module
as well. Finally, there's a bunch of lower-level supporting & utility modules.
