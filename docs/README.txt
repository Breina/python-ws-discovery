This directory contains pre-generated HTML docs suitable for use in e.g. github pages.

All the Sphinx reStructuredText source files are in _sources directory.

Run "make" to build the html sources in the current directory. Use "make help" to see
other options. Note: you of course have to first install Sphinx and the Sphinx
extensions; see _sources/conf.py for a list of ones used in this project.
